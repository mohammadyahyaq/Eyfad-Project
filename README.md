# Eyfad-Project

In this project, we tried to build an Arabic optical character recognition (OCR) platform. We called this platform Eyfad. To build this type of system, we need to collect a large amount of data of Arabic handwritten word images to train our machine learning model. Therefore, we also build Eyfad dataset which you could find it on this repository. We also build some algorithms for Segmenting, classifying, and renaming the images to enrich our dataset in more automated manner.
